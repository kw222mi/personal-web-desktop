# Personal Web Desktop (PWD)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Personal Web Desktop (PWD) project! This single-page application (SPA) brings together a set of interactive sub-applications, creating a dynamic and personalized desktop experience. This README will provide an overview of the project and its three main components: Chat, Memory Game, and a custom Weather Application.

## 1. The PWD 

The PWD serves as the central hub for our desktop experience. It mimics a traditional desktop environment with a dock that hosts icons for each sub-application. Users can enjoy a seamless and intuitive desktop-like feel, opening multiple instances of sub-applications simultaneously. The PWD is designed as a SPA and it allows users to drag and place sub-applications on top of each other.

## 2. The Memory sub-app

Our Memory Game sub-application provides a classic gaming experience. Users can flip tiles, match pairs, and clear the grid. There is also a highscore function.

## 3. The Messages sub-app

This sub-application is a course-wide message chat using Web Sockets. This application is a regular message client like WhatsApp, Signal, FB Messenger, or iMessage.

## 4. The Weather Sub-app

With the Weather Application users can seamlessly check the weather forecast within the desktop environment. This sub-application fetches real-time weather data from an API, providing a personalized weather experience.
